Our tasks for the week will be to meet up and talk about the data sets and ideas we have found, and pick the top three. We will create a general concept for what each website would look and making a quick sketch. Each member will take one idea and create a detailed sketch for that potential website. We will then review each other’s work and make adjustments as a group as necessary.
